career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
      Everybody lies but I’m able to make my lie comes true. Honestly, I was born as Aquarius, plus left-handed ginger and really I care only about one thing... FREEDOM. Physical, mental as well as spiritual. I'm unstable, lazy, crazy, manipulative, melancholic introvert looking for any problem to solve or minimaly make more confortable.

      Back in 2013, I get an idea to become a programmer, not to be limited and start to do things by myself. No school, no teacher, no friend... just Google and Youtube. It took me over an year to get a seat at programming company, then another two years to realize what I really whould like to achieve, then another almost half a decade to make it done. And yet, it's not finished, not even close and it'll never be, that idea is evolving along with me and my skills. It's not perfect, It's not buletproof and It's pretty broken but it supposed to be. Because it's made for creating, mixing and making broken-beats of any kind, any genre, any tempo at any time. It is made for broken people with a broken mind as well as the heart to fell a little bit fixed. Even for just a moment. That’s EMI - Elegant Mixing Interface …my leftover, masterpiece, a personal project including another couple of sub-projects for extended controls mapping and screen (skin) rendering, yes a “music”. Just another way how to drop the bass.

      > We create machines to do our jobs, to take over us, to solve our problems. We are the "creators" of the future living in a present which is based on our past. No matter how far... we can’t run away, we can only disconnect for a moment, until the final one.
